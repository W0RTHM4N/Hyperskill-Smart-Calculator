# Smart Calculator

My 9th Python project from Hyperskill.

This program calculates the result of an expression, received as input in any format (spaces are ignored, "--" is considered a "+").

The current version doesn't support exponents (**, ^) and operates only with integers (to match the requirements of the task).

Examples:
- ab = 13; - assigns the value "13" to a variable "ab"
- x=0;
- ab; - prints the value ("13") of the variable "ab"
- 23 - 1 * (x / 3) + ab;
- 23-1*(x/3)+ab;
- 23-   1*(x / 3 )+ab;
- 23 ---1*(x / 3) +++++++++ ab;

Commands:
- /help - prints the help message
- /exit - finishes the execution
